    <h1>About me :</h1>
    <p>about.me is a personal web hosting service co-founded by Ryan Freitas, Tony Conrad and Tim Young in October 2009. The site offers registered users a simple platform from which to link multiple online identities, relevant external sites, and popular social networking websites such as Facebook, Flickr, and Google</p>
    <p>Do you wish you could share more information about the child or young person you care for before an appointment, an activity or moving to a new nursery or school for example?’

        Do you keep having to tell your story? 
       
        The About Me can help.
       
        About Me is a person-centred profile of a child or young person. It is usually written in the words of the child or young person and focusses on what the child or young person can do and where support is needed.
       
        An About Me profile will usually be one page long – the front page is the About Me and it has the most important day to day information. On the reverse side of each template there is an opportunity to add more information on the More About Me such as your family history and additional medical or communication information.
       
        Link to the website with downloadable templates and a guide on how to complete the About Me templates. </p>
